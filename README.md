## Install

```
conda create -n hea-ml  python=3.6.7
conda activate hea-ml
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

I tested installation on ubuntu and mac OS.

The code depends on a few third-party packages. Please refer to the page for the individual package for installation details.
See requirement.txt for dependencies. 

To run the code:
```
python -m code.main
```
